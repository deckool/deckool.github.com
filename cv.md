##Related work

[Small __REST__ API] just to demonstrate my Haskell skills. The engine is written in pure Haskell and on some calls like "new/123" it returns some status true or false. It is also user-fault proof, you can not enter letters instead of numbers and so on. For more please write me as i am working on improving it. 
>Written in pure __haskell__, designed for a __tic-tac-toe game server-side__, deployed over __Heroku__ using __git__.

[Organicorange] is a wrapper around the __Github__ using repositories to form a blog.
>Based on __Snapframework__, a nice web framework written in Haskell, using __Markdown__ parsing, __Github API__ for programmatic gathering needed data. The forms are also over an numbers recognition program used for memberships based on cards or invitations for loging. It takes 16 numbers grouped 4 x 4 (you know the style) and it makes internal connections to find about the user. You can __play__ now, the numbers list is empty.
